# Dotfiles for Mac OS Sierra

> **TODO**

> ## LOADS of bloody stuff!!!

Here are my Mac OS Sierra dotfiles, they are very much a _work in progress_ and not everything is configured as yet.

## The configurations that are relatively stable and complete are as follows.

- ZSH is effectively complete along with antigen.
- PATH configuration is complete for Homebrew, Go, Rust, Ruby etc.
